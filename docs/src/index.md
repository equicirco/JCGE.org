JCGE is a modular, block-based framework for Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)
modeling in Julia. This documentation is the project entry point: it describes
architecture, workflows, and package boundaries while the package APIs live in their
own docs.

## Start here

This site is organized around a project overview, a quick start, and a set of
[cross-package guides](guides/modeling.md). Use the links below to jump to the
part of the framework you need.

If you are looking for package-level APIs, start with the
[Packages](packages.md) page.

- [Project overview](project.md): design goals and how the ecosystem fits together
- [Getting Started](getting-started.md): install packages and run your first model
- [Packages](packages.md): what each package does in the ecosystem
- [Guides](guides/modeling.md): modeling, calibration, output, and imports
- [Contact & citation](contact.md): how to cite and who to reach

## Ecosystem at a glance

JCGE is a family of focused Julia packages. The [Packages](packages.md) page gives
a quick map of the ecosystem and where to look for detailed API references.
