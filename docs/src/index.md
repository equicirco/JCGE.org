    JCGE is a modular, block-based framework for Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)
    modeling in Julia. This documentation is the project entry point: it describes
    architecture, workflows, and package boundaries while the package APIs live in their
    own docs.

## Start here

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md): install packages and run your first model
- [Packages](packages.md): what each package does in the ecosystem
- [Guides](guides/modeling.md): modeling, calibration, output, and imports

## What this project is

- Project overview and architecture
- Cross-package guides for modeling, calibration, and output
- A stable reference to how the ecosystem fits together

## What this project is not

- A single monolithic package
- The source of truth for package-level APIs (each package has its own docs)

## Ecosystem at a glance

JCGE is a family of focused Julia packages. The Packages page gives a quick map of
the ecosystem and where to look for detailed API references.
