## How to cite

JCGE is the umbrella framework; please cite it in any work that uses the ecosystem.
Each package is also versioned and archived on Zenodo with its own DOI, which provides
a stable reference point for the exact code used.

To make models easy to document and replicate, you may wish to record the package
versions used in your model's `Project.toml` and, where relevant, reference the
corresponding repository DOIs. This is optional guidance intended to give you
flexible ways to keep executions fully traceable.

If you use JCGE in your CGE models, please cite it as:
